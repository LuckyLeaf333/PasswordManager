  Have you ever forgotten a password? Mixed up your login for Netflix and Amazon?
  Found yourself lost in a sea of "Enter your mother's maiden name" and "What was the name of your first pet"?
  Annoyed trying to find yet another different special character?
  Look no further than Final Projectors Password Manager. 
  
  Our console and GUI* application can set, load, store and update 
  any number of passwords your heart may desire.
  Our easy-to-use interface gets your passwords copied and you logged in,
  all with breathtaking efficiency.
  When our application is not running, your passwords are secure.
  All data is encrypted at rest using NSA-grade cryptography**, 
  meaning none of your logins or passwords can be read 
  without your master password - not even by us.
  Enjoy all the luxuries of the modern day with backups and synchronization
  across devices*, meaning you'll never leave your passwords at home.
  
  * To be potentially added later.
  ** The NSA uses the same cryptography as everyone else.
